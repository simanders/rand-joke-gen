Joke Generator using public Joke API.

This project is a simple JavaScript script that fetches a joke from a joke API and displays it on a webpage. It uses event listeners to trigger the fetching of a joke when a button is clicked. The fetched joke is then displayed in a designated HTML element, with a fade effect applied for visual appeal. The script immediately fetches and displays a joke upon loading the webpage as well. Overall, it provides a basic and interactive way for users to receive and enjoy a random joke at the click of a button.
